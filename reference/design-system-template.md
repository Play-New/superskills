# Design System Template

Generated by `/super:design` init mode. Lives at `.superskills/design-system.md` in the user's project. Contains the aesthetic direction, token definitions, and component measurements that the token guard hook and design awareness skill enforce.

# Design System

## Direction
**Feel:** [intent statement — not "clean and modern" but something specific]
**Domain concepts:** [5+ metaphors from the product's world]
**Rejected defaults:** [3 things explicitly NOT doing]

## Tokens
**Spacing base:** [e.g. 4px]
**Scale:** [e.g. 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48]
**Radius:** [per style preset or custom]
**Depth strategy:** [borders-only / subtle-shadows / layered]
**Color primitives:** [foreground levels, surfaces, accent, semantic]

## Component Patterns

| Component | Height | Padding | Radius | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| [populated as components are built] | | | | |

## Decisions
| Decision | Why | Date |
|----------|-----|------|
| [first decision from init] | [rationale] | [date] |
```
