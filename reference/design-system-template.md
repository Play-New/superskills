# Design System Template

Generated by `/super:design` init mode. Lives at `.superskills/design-system.md` in the user's project. Contains the aesthetic direction, token definitions, and component measurements that the token guard hook and design awareness skill enforce.

# Design System

## Direction
**Feel:** [intent statement — not "clean and modern" but something specific]
**Domain concepts:** [5+ metaphors from the product's world]
**Color world:** [5+ colors from this product's physical domain]
**Signature:** [one element that could only exist for THIS product]
**Rejected defaults:** [3 things explicitly NOT doing]

## References
**Borrowed:** [specific patterns from references: "tight sidebar density from Linear", "amber-on-dark from the dashboard screenshot"]
**Avoided:** [specific anti-patterns: "generic card grid", "low-contrast body text"]
**Assets:** [brand materials incorporated: "logo uses geometric sans, informed display font choice"]

## Information Architecture
**Navigation:** [type] — [items, 5-8 max]
**Excluded from nav:** [what was cut, where it lives instead]

| Screen | Focal Point | Above the Fold | One Click | Deep |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-----------|------|
| [screen] | [one element] | [2-4 items] | [behind tab/drawer] | [behind nav/search] |

**Content depth rules:**
- Surface: [what qualifies — tied to task frequency]
- One click: [what qualifies]
- Deep: [what qualifies]

## Tokens
**Spacing base:** [e.g. 4px]
**Scale:** [e.g. 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48]
**Radius:** [per style preset or custom]
**Depth strategy:** [borders-only / subtle-shadows / layered]
**Color primitives:** [foreground levels, surfaces, accent, semantic]

## Component Patterns

| Component | Height | Padding | Radius | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| [populated as components are built] | | | | |

## Decisions
| Decision | Why | Date |
|----------|-----|------|
| [first decision from init] | [rationale] | [date] |
```
